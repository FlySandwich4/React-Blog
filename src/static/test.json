I feel amazing when I first study this framework since it has some new things compared with other frameworks. <br /> This job also improve my teamwork ability. By working with a lot of people, I acquired more knowledge on project management and organization. I tried to organize my project better and coding more clear in the future projects, where the project “Duck Duck Ride” is an example. Making project more organized is better for people to develop."
