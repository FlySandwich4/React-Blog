We realized that transportation expenses can be burdensome, especially for students and people who don't have access to a car. With Duck Duck Ride, we aim to make travel more accessible, affordable, and environmentally friendly."

During the development, I find designing the structure is the most important thing. A good structrue helps seperated codes and beaviours, which makes the whole backend APIs clear, much easier to understand.      <br/> Also, I spent a lot of time thinking how the database should be like. A basic database must able to satisfy the requirements of storage. However, A good database is both easy to use and more extendable. I learned a lot in designing databases during the development. Although my design might not be the best, I will keep study!"
